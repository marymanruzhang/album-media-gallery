# Project 3: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, rather leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Design Plan (Milestone 1)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.


### Catalog (Milestone 1)
> What will your catalog website be about? (1 sentence)

album music catalog

### _Consumer_ Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's _consumer_ audience. Your audience should be specific, but not arbitrarily specific. (1 sentence)
> Justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group. (1-2 sentences)

The consumer audience are those who are interested in the graphics and aesthetics of music promotion and album covers.

This is a cohesive audience because they are an unique group who are interested in art specifically in the field of music.


### _Consumer_ Audience Goals (Milestone 1)
> Document your _consumer_ audience's goals for using this catalog website.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1. But probably not more than 3.)
> **Hint:** Hint: Users will be able to view all entries in the catalog and the details for a catalog entry. The audience's goals should probably relate to these activities.

Goal 1: Users should be able to filter catalog entries by a tag which filters the genres of the music of the album

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - I will meet this goal by creating an user-friendly filter button that makes it easy for the consumer users to find and filter for different genres,
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - This is important so that the user can easily find the albums associated with the genres they are looking for.

Goal 2: Users should be able to view all entries of album covers in the catalog at once

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - There will be a matrix of entries for the catalog with each album cover as a thumbnail.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - This makes it easy for the user to view all the different album covers at first glance and able to find which ones entices them iin an orderly fashion.

Goal 3: Users should be able to view a detailed version of an album cover on a separate page that lists more information about both the album and the artwork

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - I will meet this goal by linking each thumbnail to a detailed page where there are detailed information about each album.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - This makes sense since the user can easily access the information by pressing the image of the album cover.


### _Consumer_ Audience Device (Milestone 1)
> How will your _consumer_ audience access this website? From a narrow (phone) or wide (laptop) device?
> Justify your decision. (1 sentence)

The consumer audience will access this website from a wide device.

I think from an artistic perspective, the album covers look better on a wider screen and is more easy for viewing


### _Consumer_ Persona (Milestone 1)
> Use the goals you identified above to develop a persona of your site's _consumer_ audience.
> Your persona must have a name and a face. The face can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.

Jenny

**Factors that Influence Behavior:**

- Type of music Jenny is interested in
- Accesibility to the details of albums Jenny is finding

**Goals:**

- Easy access to the album covers of the type of music genres Jenny is interest in
- To see beautiful graphics of album covers

**Obstacles:**

- Sorting through the albums to find the genre Jenny is interested in
- Finding more details and information of the albums (artist of the album and other information) Jenny finds interesting at first glance

**Desires:**

- Jenny wants to see more beautifully designed album covers of different music genres
- Jenny would like to learn more about album covers recommended by others


### _Administrator_ Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's _administrator_ audience. Your audience should be specific, but not arbitrarily specific. (1 sentence)
> Justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group. (1-2 sentences)

The administrator audience are those who are interested in contributing to the catalog which are most likely the creators of the album covers.

This is a cohesive audience because the creators of the album covers are likely to want to share their works in a platform for others to see.

### _Administrator_ Audience Goals (Milestone 1)
> Document your _administrator_ audience's goals for using this catalog website.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1. But probably not more than 3.)
> **Hint:** Users will be able to view all entries in the catalog and insert new entries into the catalog. The audience's goals should probably relate to these activities.

Goal 1: Administrator users should be able to insert new entries and delete entries.

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - There will be an insert form implemeneted when the administrator user is logged in so they can add entries and there will be a button for each catalog that shows up by the thumbnail if you are logged in so the administrator can delete the entry.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - This important so that only administrators are able to delete entries and not just any user.

Goal 2: Administrative users should be able to upload one media file for the entry

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - There will be an insert form implemeneted when the administrator user is logged in.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - This important so that only creators are able to insert their works into the catalog. It is also easy for the creators to upload and showcase their work by just filling out a form.

Goal 3: Administrative users should be able to assign multiple tags to an entry upon creation
- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - There will be an insert form implemeneted when the administrator user is logged in which will allow them to insert tags.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - The administrator can add tags to entries they upload which will make it easier for the consumer users to filter.


### _Administrator_ Persona (Milestone 1)
> Use the goals you identified above to develop a persona of your site's _administrator_ audience.
> Your persona must have a name and a face. The face can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.

 ![cassie](/design-plan/cassie.jpg)

Cassie

**Factors that Influence Behavior:**

- Exposure to a wider collection
- Easy to filter through genres

**Goals:**

- Find pretty album covers and make a collection for herself
- Know what type of genres each album is

**Obstacles:**

- Hard to find a collection of cool album covers to look at for design reference and for fun
- Hard to figure out what type of albums are what genre and if there is a pattern in the art

**Desires:**

- Able to find different references for album designs
- Have a easy to see grid of albums wwith details about each album as well

### Catalog Data (Milestone 1)
> Using your personas, identify the data you need to include in the catalog for your site's audiences.
> Justify why this data aligns with your persona's goals. (1 sentence)

Album Name
Artist Name
Album Year Released
Album Genres
Album Cover Illustrations
Upload Form


These are important data to help Cassie to have a well-rounded background of each album for her own collection. Not only will she be able to see the visuals of the album cover but more details about each album.


### Site Design (Milestone 1)
> Design your catalog website to address the goals of your personas.
> Sketch your site's design:
>
> - These are **design** sketches, not _planning_ sketches.
> - Use text in the sketches to help us understand your design.
> - Where the content of the text is unimportant, you may use squiggly lines for text.
> - **Do not label HTML elements or annotate CSS classes.** This is not a planning sketch.
>
> Provide a brief explanation _underneath_ each sketch. (1 sentence)
> **Refer to your persona by name in each explanation.**

 ![sketch](/design-plan/sketch.jpg)
For the catalog home page, it is a matrix style catalog with thumbnails that lead to a details page with more information of the album cover thumbnail that was pressed by Cassie. Cassie can add entries by pressing the upload icon in the middle.

Moreover, for Jenny, she can filter the album covers by genre with the filter button.

### Catalog Design Patterns (Milestone 1)
> Explain how you used design patterns in your site's design. (1-2 sentences)

I used design patterns of alignment through the matrix of thumbnails. I also used responsivenes design through the filter button.

## Implementation Plan (Milestone 1, Milestone 2, Milestone 3, Final Submission)

### Database Schema (Milestone 1)
> Plan the structure of your database. You may use words or a picture.
> A bulleted list is probably the simplest way to do this.
> Make sure you include constraints for each field.

-- Albums --
CREATE TABLE albums (
    id INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    artist TEXT NOT NULL,
    year INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(id AUTOINCREMENT)
);

-- Album tags (connects types of genre with the album entry) --
CREATE TABLE album_tags (
    id INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    album_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    tags_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(id AUTOINCREMENT) FOREIGN KEY (album_id) REFERENCES albums(id)
    FOREIGN KEY (tags_id) REFERENCES tags(id)
);

-- Genre tags (all the different genres) --
CREATE TABLE tags (
    id INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    genre TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(id AUTOINCREMENT)
);


### Database Query Plan (Milestone 1, Milestone 2, Milestone 3, Final Submission)
> Plan _all_ of your database queries.
> You may use natural language, pseudocode, or SQL.

  $result = exec_sql_query(
        $db,
        "SELECT albums.name AS 'albums.name', tags.genre AS 'tags.genre'

        FROM album_tags INNER JOIN albums ON (album_tags.album_id = albums.id)
        INNER JOIN tags ON (album_tags.tags_id = tags.id);"
      );
      $records = $result->fetchAll();

## Complete & Polished Website (Final Submission)

### Accessibility Audit (Final Submission)
> Tell us what issues you discovered during your accessibility audit.
> What do you do to improve the accessibility of your site?

I didn't have any audit issues this times. I struggled with remembering to check the contrast errors on each page in the previous project and I remembered to check through all the pages this time.

### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from Projects 1 and 2?

I think I have understand client-side programming and php a lot better compared to projects 1 and 2 just due to the share amount of new content needed to be absrobed and impelemented.


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments! (1-3 sentences)

I think I have learned so much in this class so far despite it being a struggle recently to keep up on the progress of the project because of all the projects in other classes that are simulatenously happening. I am proud to see what I made so far but I hope I can have more time to polish the website.
